# Snapchat-Bitmojis-Extractor
I learned about this vulnerability from
<br></br>
(https://hatless1der.com/a-snapchat-osint-tip-viewing-bitmoji-changes/)
<br></br>
This is a brilliant discovery by Micah Hoffman and Sir Griffin.
I didn't knew about any tool doing this while i was writing this script.
But there is an official web based tool<br></br>https://webbreacher.github.io/osinttools/ by Micah Hoffman. You can check out.

Dependencies
1. Selenium
2. Python
```
pip install selenium
```
You need selenium fully setup to run this script which include webdrivers of browser.

Watch this [Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjv1sY630Uc&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-n40rB1XaJ0ak1bemvlqumQ) for full setup details of selenium.
To use my tool just download download script.py file.
Run by this command in terminal
```
script.py username
```
